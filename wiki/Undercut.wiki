== Introduction ==

Undercut is an extremely small addon that finds the competing items at the Auction House
so you can ruthlessly undercut them. Alt-LClick on an item in your bag while at the AH to
search. Undercut sets the auction frame level range (+/-3 of item level), category, etc.
to match the clicked item, switches to the "Browse" tab, and runs the search.

== Setup ==

Nothing special. Just copy the folder to your addons dir and go.
