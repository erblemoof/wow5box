#summary World of Warcraft addon for painless, focus-free multibox targeting and follow
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

ActionBarTargeting is a WoW addon that automatically creates targeting and follow macros for a multibox team of
characters. The targeting system is based on the [http://www.wowwiki.com/Making_a_macro#Complete_list actionbar]
conditional (active actionbar page), so focus is kept free for defining crowd control targets. Team membership
is defined using the companion addon MultiboxRoster.

Targeting macros are bound to invisible buttons that can be `/click`'ed to do the appropriate actions. For example,
the following macro will make one of your shaman followers target your main's target (unless they already have a
hostile target) and cast Lightning Bolt:

{{{
/click SetOffensiveTarget
/cast Lightning Bolt
}}}

The macro for SetOffensiveTarget is slightly different on each character. For example, on the 3rd character
in a team of 5, the macro looks like this:

{{{
/startattack
/stopmacro [exists,harm,nodead]
/assist [bar:1] Toon1; [bar:2] Toon2; [bar:4] Toon4; [bar:5] Toon5
}}}

The first line starts auto-attack. The second line makes targeting sticky -- if your follower already has a
hostile target they will stay on that target even if your main changes to a different one. The third line assists
your current main, as defined by the current action bar page.

To switch mains, just use whatever key your have bound to actionbar pages 1-5. For me this is F1-F5, but you can use
whatever you like. (You can even change the active page in a macro using `/changeactionbar`, hmmm...)

Once you define your teams with MultiboxRoster, ActionBarTargeting automatically recognizes the active team
and updates your macros accordingly. Switching teams is as easy as logging in on the new characters and adding
them to a group or raid.

== List of Macros ==

ActionBarTargeting creates the following macros/buttons:
    * SetOffensiveTarget: Instructs a clone to assist your main.
    * SetHealingTarget: Clone targets your main's target (if friendly) or else your main.
    * TargetMain: Clone to targets your main.
    * TargetMainTarget: Clone to targets your main's target.
    * FollowMain: Clone follows your main.
To see the macro code type `/abt print` in game.
    
== Advantages ==

    * Focus-free targeting and follow.
    * Automatically recognizes the active team (using MultiboxRoster) and updates macros accordingly.
    * Works fine in battlegrounds, even if your toons wind up in different groups.
    * One button selection of main, even in combat, using actionbar page keybinds.

== Limitations ==

    * Won't work well if you use action bar pages for another purpose, for instance if you use separate melee and ranged attack bars on a hunter.
    * Macros are not easily customizable. If you're not happy with mine your only recourse is to edit the definitions in `ActionBarTargeting.lua`. I know this sucks -- I'm working on something better.

= Setup =

    # Install the companion addon MultiboxRoster and follow the instructions to define your team(s).
    # For each of your offensive spells, create a macro like this:
    This will tell your follower shaman to target
