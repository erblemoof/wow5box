#summary World of Warcraft addon for painless, focus-free multibox targeting and follow

== Introduction ==

ActionBarTargeting is a WoW addon that automatically creates targeting and follow macros for a multibox team of
characters. The targeting system is based on the [http://www.wowwiki.com/Making_a_macro#Complete_list actionbar]
conditional (active actionbar page), not focus, so focus is kept free for defining crowd control targets.

Targeting macros are bound to invisible buttons that can be /click'ed to do the appropriate actions. For example,
the following macro will make one of your shaman followers target your main's target (unless they already have a
hostile target) and cast Lightning Bolt:

{{{
/click SetOffensiveTarget
/cast Lightning Bolt
}}}

The macro for the SetOffensiveTarget is slightly different on each character. For example, on the 3rd character
in a team of 5, the macro looks like this:

{{{
/startattack
/stopmacro [exists,harm,nodead]
/assist [bar:1] Toon1; [bar:2] Toon2; [bar:4] Toon4; [bar:5] Toon5
}}}

The first line starts auto-attack. The second line makes targeting sticky -- if your follower already has a
hostile target they will stay on that target even if your main changes to a different one. The third line assists
your current main, as defined by the current action bar page.
Once you define your teams (using the
companion addon MultiboxRoster), ActionBarTargeting automatically recognizes which team is currently active and
updates your macros. Switching teams is as easy as logging in on the new characters and adding them to a group
or raid.

=== List of Macros ===



    * SetOffensiveTarget: Instructs a clone to assist your main.
    * SetHealingTarget: Clone targets your main's target (if friendly) or else your main.
    * TargetMain: Clone to targets your main.
    * TargetMainTarget: Clone to targets your main's target.
    * FollowMain: Clone follows your main.

=== Advantages ===

    * Focus-free targeting and follow
    * Automatically recognizes the active team (using MultiboxRoster) and updates macros accordingly
    * Works fine in battlegrounds, even if your toons wind up in different groups

=== Limitations ===

    * Won't work well if you use action bar pages for another purpose, for instance if you use separate melee and ranged attack bars on a hunter.
    * Macros are not easily customizable yet. If you're not happy with mine your only recourse is to edit the definitions in `ActionBarTargeting.lua`. (I know this sucks -- I'm working on it.)

== Setup ==

    # Install the companion addon MultiboxRoster and follow the instructions to define your team(s).
    # For each of your offensive spells, create a macro like this:
    This will tell your follower shaman to target

== How It Works ==

The original idea for a targeting system based on action bars was proposed by Maqz on
