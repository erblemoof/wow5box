= Introduction =

ActionBarTargeting is an addon that automatically creates targeting macros for a multibox team of characters. These macros are bound to buttons that can be /click'ed to do the appropriate actions.

== How It Works ==

The original idea for a targeting system based on action bars was proposed by Maqz on [http://www.dual-boxing.com/forums/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=4605&s=738cc98ae8e3b100b9f71057105c44a1e43497f1 dual-boxing.com].

== Limitations ==
* Won't work well if you use action bar pages for another purpose, for instance if you use separate melee and ranged attack bars on a hunter.
