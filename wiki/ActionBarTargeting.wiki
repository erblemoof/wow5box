#summary World of Warcraft addon for painless, focus-free multibox targeting
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

ActionBarTargeting is a WoW addon that automatically creates targeting macros for a multibox team of characters. The targeting system is based on action bar pages, not focus, so focus is kept free for defining crowd control targets. Targeting macros are bound to invisible buttons that can be /click'ed to do the appropriate actions. Once you define your teams (using the companion addon MultiboxRoster), ActionBarTargeting automatically recognizes which team is currently active and updates your macros. Switching teams is as easy as logging in on the new characters and adding them to a group or raid.

== List of Macros ==


    * `SetOffensiveTarget`: Instructs a clone to assist your main.
    * `SetHealingTarget`: Clone targets your main's target (if friendly) or else your main.
    * `TargetMain`: Clone to targets your main.
    * `TargetMainTarget`: Clone to targets your main's target.
    * `FollowMain`: Clone follows your main.

== Advantages ==

== Limitations ==

    * Won't work well if you use action bar pages for another purpose, for instance if you use separate melee and ranged attack bars on a hunter.
    * Macros are not easily customizable yet. If you're not happy with mine your only recourse is to edit the definitions in `ActionBarTargeting.lua`. (I know this sucks -- I'm working on it.)

= Setup =

    # Install the companion addon MultiboxRoster and follow the instructions to define your team(s).
    # For each of your offensive spells, create a macro like this:
        {{{
        /click SetOffensiveTarget
        /cast Lightning Bolt
        }}}
        This will instruct your follower shaman to target
